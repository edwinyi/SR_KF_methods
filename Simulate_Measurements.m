% Linear Discrete-time model simulation
%
% Input:
%     matrices     - system matrices F,G,H,R etc.
%     N_total      - number of measuremens to generate
%     P0,bar_x0    - Initials
%     start_mode   - is 'true' if we want to start the simulation from the
%                    exact bar_x0; otherwise we start from random N(bar_x0,P0)
%                    Default is true 
% Output:
%     Time         - discrete-time grid
%     ExactX       - stochastic state vector;
%     measurements - system measurements;
